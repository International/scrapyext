scrapyext
=========

[scrapyext][scrapyext.git] is meant as a source for code samples and modules
related to the [Scrapy][scrapy.git] framework.

Code in this repo may be deprecated or not work with current scrapy versions,
isn't endorsed or supported by anyone, and might not be fit for any use.
Quality of code may differ vastly between modules.

About
-----

[Scrapy][scrapy.git] and [scrapylib][scrapylib.git] take well-written and
well-tested code fitting the scope of these projects.
Code that doesn't fit those constraints (because of missing tests,
being hacks, lacking quality, or simply not fitting the scope) might still be
useful to others for ideas or to improve.

As such `scrapyext` should be seen as a namespace to find scrapy modules,
hacks and related code, that are outside the scope of scrapy/lib.
